<B>Color Detector Device</B>
<p>
Developed a custom Color Detection Device using Machine Learning and Arduino.
Similar to color vision of human eye, as well as based in light,this RGB model comprises more than 16 million colors, which are arranged in a 3D space.
The tools used are MLP , Arduino, LDR Sensor,RGB diffused common anode, Resistor, Push button , LCD display.</p>
